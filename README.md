# DSA Assignment 1 - Binary Trees and Hash Tables

In this project, we aim to explore and compare the efficiency of different data structures for search operations, insertion, and deletion in dynamic sets. We will implement four distinct data structures and evaluate their performance in various scenarios.

## Implemented Data Structures

### Binary Search Trees (BVS)
1. **Balancing Algorithm: AVL**
   - Implementation of a binary search tree using the AVL balancing algorithm.

2. **Balancing Algorithm: Splay Tree
   - Another binary search tree implementation with a different balancing algorithm, specifically using Splay Tree.

### Hash Tables
3. **Collision Resolution: Chaining**
   - Implementation of a hash table with collision resolution through chaining. Includes dynamic adjustment of hash table size.

4. **Collision Resolution: Open Addressing**
   - Second hash table implementation with a different collision resolution method - open addressing. Similar to the previous point, it includes dynamic adjustment of hash table size.


## Technical Documentation

The technical documentation provided alongside the implementations details the characteristics and functionalities of each implemented data structure. In addition to the implementations, a comprehensive testing program is included in a single source file containing the main function.

### Documentation Points Breakdown

- **Correctness Verification:** Evaluate the correctness through testing and comparison with other implementations.
- **Documentation Quality:** 8 points for detailed documentation, including thorough testing scenarios and analysis of effectiveness.
- **Testing Scenarios:** Identify and document situations where each implementation is more effective.
